# Reddit Webscraping Project (via PRAW and the Reddit API)
For this project, webscraping is performed on Reddit using its API via the PRAW module in Python. The aim of this project is to extract submission data from the r/Sports subreddit, categorise the submissions by their Reddit flairs, and find out if it's possible to determine the most popular (discussed) sport by total number of upvotes. 

URL to the r/Sports subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/

Included in this repository are a pptx (powerpoint) file, in which my findings are presented, and a ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file, where my code is written and executed. 

Important notes: 
- Due to the recent changes in Reddit's API in June-July 2023, the PRAW module may or may not work. This project was done prior to the API changes.
- The code cannot be run as it is. One must first register for access to Reddit's API, then insert their authentication into PRAW's code in order to gain access.
